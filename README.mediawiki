= LizardBot-PHP =
New source code repository for FastLizard4's PHP IRC bot.  Migrated from Google Code, and is the new authoritative
location for the bot and its source code.

For more information, please visit LizardBot's homepage on LizardWiki [http://fastlizard4.org/wiki/LizardBot here].

== Download Information ==
To download your very own copy of LizardBot, you may either clone this very git repository (submitting pull requests
if you find something to improve is ''highly'' encouraged!) or download a tagged release.  When looking at tags,
here's what to look for:

*The latest development version of LizardBot is the repository HEAD.  It may or may not be tagged.
*Stable versions are tagged by version number.  For example, ''rel7.2.0.0'' points to version 7.2.0.0 of LizardBot.
**Note that if HEAD is a tagged revision, that effectively means that the latest development version is stable, or at least relatively so.

'''Remember that development HEADs may be highly unstable, so <span style="color: #F00;">results are not guaranteed</span>!'''

=== Branches ===
In general, you should always download your LizardBot from the master branch.  Other branches may exist, but usually only temporarily
for testing different features without breaking the main bot.  If you are interested in helping to test out those features, take a look
at that branch's README to see what it's about, and check it out if you want!  Similarly, you will only find tagged releases on the master branch.

Expect branches other than master to be '''HIGHLY''' unstable!

== Issues and Bugs ==
If you'd like to report a bug, you may use ''either'' the GitHub issue tracker [https://github.com/FastLizard4/LizardBot-PHP/issues here]
'''''OR''''' LizardBugs [http://fastlizard4.org/bugzilla/ here].  Please do not report the same bug in both places.  When an issue is opened
on GitHub, someone will copy it over to BugZilla for detailed tracking and such.  However, if you open an issue directly on BugZilla, it will
''not'' be copied over to GitHub issues.

If you find a bug and want to fix it yourself, remember that pull requests are encouraged!
